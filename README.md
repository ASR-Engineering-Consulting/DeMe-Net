# DeMe-Net
### A CNN architecture to Diagnosis of Dermatology Melanoma Skin Cancer using parallel convolution.
### The DeMe Net architecture is achieves 98.33% accuracy on testing data and 99.85% on the traininge detaset.


### We used the HAM10000 dataset from Kaggle, which was published by ISIC for the 2018 ML Challenge.
